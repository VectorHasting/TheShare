Legislation for a Flat Tax on Income combined with a Universal Based Income as a minimum percentage of GDP.

Based on two books: 
The Share: A New Social Contract by Vector Hasting, independenty published 2019
and
The Flat Tax (Second Edition) by Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, published 1985 and revised 2007

Note 1: This legislation amends Title 26, also known as "The Internal Revenue Code." 
Title 26 can be found in its entirety at: https://uscode.house.gov/download/download.shtml

Note 2: Title 26 has ten "Subtitles," the principle one is Subtitle A, which deals with Income Tax. 
Subtitle A is 2,000 pages long, or almost twice as long as the remaining nine Subtitles of Title 26
combined. 

Note 3: The Share: A New Social Contract, references the work of Hall and Rabushka, adding legislative language 
to provide, and argue for, Universal Base Income, called The Share in that book because it is a share of GDP. 

Note 4: The work of Hall and Rabushka is also the bases of H-R bill 1040 introduced into congress. 
However, that bill ALSO included repealing SUBTITLE B of Title 26, which deals with inheritance tax.

Note 5: Vector Hasting is mounting a 2020 democratic presidential bid to promote this legislation.
